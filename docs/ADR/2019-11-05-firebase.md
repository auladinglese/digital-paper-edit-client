Technical Story: Evaluating Firebase for our backend, replacing most of the AWS infrastructure, except for PSTT client (queue and instance to talk to PSTT)

## Context and Problem Statement

We have quite a few components to build up in the backend to get DPE to a stable point. Working on AWS had been quite challenging with a steep learning curve. Since Firebase is a plaftorm that targets development for startups and R&D, it provides many features out of the box. This could speed up developing the backend, namely the realtime database, authentication, while keeping possibilities open for offline, mobile, and multi-user solutions. We must consider technical (security, development, upfront learning) and non-technical (legal) cost.

## Decision Drivers

- Security (Authentication, PSTT integration)
- Legal
- Technical feasibility of DPE only
- Technical feasibility of CI, reproduceability
- Cost (time, money, engineering, ooportunity)

## Considered Options

- AWS only architecture
- Firebase and AWS combined

## Decision Outcome

Most likely Firebase and AWS combined if PSTT integration is feasible

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Faster development
- Managed services with many abstractions
- Better understanding of GCP

### Negative consequences <!-- optional -->

- Upfront cost of learning
- Redesigning architecture (cost and time)
- Redesinging database model with reuse of previous model
